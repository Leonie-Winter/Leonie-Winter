## Who am i
Hi im Leonie (or Winter for all the English folk who struggle with pronuncing that), i like all kinds of humanities and programming. When im not doing Sysadmin stuff, you'll find me writing low-level drivers or tinkering with hardware i probably found on the street.

## Programming Stats

I like writing in C and have plenty of experience with Python and SQL.

I only started uploading everything to GitHub in my last year of school, so here are my stats so far.
