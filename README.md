## Who am i
Hi I'm Leonie (or Winter for those who find the German pronunciation tricky), I like all kinds of engineering, humanities and programming. I'm passionate about hardware, some homelabbing, or tinkering with hardware I probably found on the street.

### From School

Some things i learned during my proper education:
- pcb design, sensors and microcontrollers with ![MORRIGAN](https://github.com/Leonie-Winter/MORRIGAN).

- basics of algorithms and ![programming with python](https://github.com/Leonie-Winter/WhosThatPokemon), 

- ![databases](https://github.com/Leonie-Winter/contact-manager) and cryptology.

Each of these had a seperate project which i linked to.
